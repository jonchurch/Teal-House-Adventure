I need to create ways to access the objects with their associated methods intact.

This likely means using constructor functions

Ranvier uses an array full of rooms, and a getAt(indexNum) to return the full instance of a Room. 
How do I put those rooms into an object?
Currently I am storing my rooms in a js file called teal.js

I will need a rooms@object, player@object, and a room@object

First up is the Player constructor! I think it's a good idea to create a load function for my new Player instances, I can load the data which I am already saving into the botkit storage.

self.load(config){ self.vum = blah }
